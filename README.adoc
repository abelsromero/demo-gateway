= Spring Cloud Gateway Security Filter

== Example

The example has Spring Cloud Gateway filter wrapped in Spring Security chain.
This model takes advantage of the Spring Security infrastructure to provide the following advantages:

* Stores Authentication information in the Security context.
Allowing access to it from other filters using `ReactiveSecurityContextHolder`.
* Enforces best practices to organize code.

** Reading and authenticating (aka. validating) the credentials is split in 2 components:
*** AuthenticationConverter: processes HTTP request to extract any required information (does not validate).
*** AuthenticationManager: validates the credentials previously extracted.

** Error handing is isolated:
*** ServerAccessDeniedHandler: (configured via `exceptionHandling` method) handles response in case the request is not authenticated.
It can be extracted into a class if ones to organize the code.
In the example, it's embeded as a lambda for simplicity

** Credentials and user information is decoupled from transfer protocol: no need to deal with HTTP elements once the `Authentication object is created in the `AuthenticationConverter`.
** Logic is clearly separated in Spring Cloud Gateway and Spring Security components, making the security part reusable for other Spring Boot apps.


This is not free however, the downsides however are:

* Coupling with Spring Security components: this can be mitigated using Delegator pattern.
Some is shown in the example, see how `CookieAuthenticationConverter` delegates most of the logic to AuthCookieParser.
Likewise, validation/authentication logic could be extracted into an independent class instead of being embedded in `CookieAuthenticationManager`.
* Steeper learning curve: some knowledge of how Spring Security chains work is necessary.

== Running the example

The filter expects a cookie names `auth-cookie` containing a Base64 encoded JSON content with some properties.

.JSON content example
 {"username":"me","session-id":"123","issued-at":"2023-10-26T20:16:00.000","ttl":"24h"}


Simply, start the application `DemoGatewayApplication` and use one of the following curl calls:

.Complete cURL call example
 curl --cookie "auth-cookie=eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Im1lIiwic2Vzc2lvbi1pZCI6IjEyMyIsImlzc3VlZC1hdCI6IjIwMjMtMTAtMjZUMjA6MTY6MDAuMDAwIiwidHRsIjoiMjRoIn0=" \
http://localhost:8080/test/get -v

This call responds with a successful status `200 OK` given the token hasn't expire

.Example of expired
 curl --cookie "auth-cookie=eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Im1lIiwic2Vzc2lvbi1pZCI6IjEyMyIsImlzc3VlZC1hdCI6IjIwMjMtMTAtMjZUMjA6MTY6MDAuMDAwIiwidHRsIjoiMTBzIn0=" \
http://localhost:8080/test/get -v


== Advanced

The example does not handle redirections automatically.
Those will need to be handled in the `exceptionHandling` setting status and `Location` manually.

If one wants to handle them automatically, it's possible to use `formLogin` to automate it.

[,java]
----
.formLogin(formLoginSpec ->  {
    formLoginSpec
            .loginPage("/url/to-redirect")
            .authenticationManager(authenticationManager);
})
